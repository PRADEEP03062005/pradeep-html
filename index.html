<p> The project number
    A Firebase project (and its associated Google Cloud project) has a project number. This is the Google-assigned globally unique canonical identifier for the project. Use this identifier when configuring integrations and/or making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.
    <br>
    You cannot edit a project number. If you delete a project, the project number is also deleted and can never be used again by any other project.</p>
